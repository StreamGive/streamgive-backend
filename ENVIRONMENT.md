# Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (and `.env.test.example` to `.env.test` for
the test suite) and fill these in.

| Variable                      | Required | Default                                | Notes                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`                 | Yes      | —                                        | Postgres connection string. Inside `docker compose`, the backend service overrides this to point at the `postgres` service, not `localhost`. |
| `PORT`                         | No       | `3000`                                   | Port the Fastify server listens on.                                                              |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`               | No       | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`    | Soroban RPC endpoint the indexer polls.                                                          |
| `NGO_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID`      | No*      | — (empty)                                | Deployed `ngo-registry` contract id. See `streamgive-contracts/deployments.json`. The indexer no-ops until both contract ids are set. |

| `INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`      | No       | `5000`                                   | How often the indexer polls `getEvents`.                                                         |
| `INDEXER_MAX_EVENTS_PER_POLL`   | No       | RPC default                              | Positive integer limiting events fetched and processed per poll. The event cursor is checkpointed so the next poll resumes after the last handled event. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`                  | No       | `http://localhost:3001`                  | Comma-separated origins allowed to call this API from a browser.                                |

| `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`            | No       | — (empty)                                | If set, stream lifecycle events (`stream_created`/`stream_withdrawn`/`stream_cancelled`) are POSTed here as JSON.                                |

| `RATE_LIMIT_APPLICATION_MAX`    | No       | `5`                                      | Maximum number of NGO application submissions allowed per time window.                         |

| `NODE_ENV`                      | No       | unset (treated as development)           | Set to `production` to switch logging to structured JSON instead of pino-pretty. Set automatically inside the Docker image. |

\* Required for the indexer to do anything; the app runs fine without them, it just never sees on-chain events.
\*\* Required for the admin review endpoints to work at all; everything else in the API works without it.


| `RESEND_API_KEY` | No | — | Resend API key used to send email notifications. Email notifications remain in log-only stub mode when this is unset. |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM` | No | — | Sender address used by Resend. Required when `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured. |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO` | No | — | Recipient address for notification emails. Email notifications are skipped when this is unset. |
