# Indexer

The indexer polls the Stellar RPC for contract events emitted by the two
StreamGive smart contracts and writes the results into the PostgreSQL database.
It runs as a background loop inside the same Node.js process as the API server
(see [`src/indexer/worker.ts`](../src/indexer/worker.ts)).

## Watched contracts

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NGO_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Tracks NGO registrations and admin approvals |
| `DONATION_VAULT_CONTRACT_ID` | Tracks streaming donation lifecycle (create / withdraw / cancel) |

Both ids are optional. The indexer no-ops until at least one is set.

## Event table

Each row shows one on-chain event topic, whether the indexer handles it, and
which database rows it creates or updates when it does.

### ngo-registry contract

| Topic | Handled | DB writes |
|---|---|---|
| `register` | Yes | Upserts `ngos` row (`ownerAddress`, `name`, `verified = false`). Updates `name` if the row already exists. |
| `approved` | Yes | Sets `verified = true` on the matching `ngos` row via `updateMany` (no-ops if the row does not exist yet — safe for a mid-history start). |
| `revoked` | Yes | Sets `verified = false` on the matching `ngos` row via `updateMany` (no-ops if the row does not exist yet). |

Handler: [`src/indexer/handlers/ngoRegistry.ts`](../src/indexer/handlers/ngoRegistry.ts)

### donation-vault contract

| Topic | Handled | DB writes |
|---|---|---|
| `created` | Yes | Upserts `donors` and `ngos` rows for the involved addresses (creating placeholders if unseen), then upserts a `streams` row with `status = ACTIVE`, initial `balance`, and `withdrawn = 0`. Emits a `stream_created` webhook notification. |
| `withdraw` | Yes | Subtracts the accrued amount from `streams.balance` and adds it to `streams.withdrawn`. No-ops if the stream row does not exist. Emits a `stream_withdrawn` notification. |
| `cancel`| Yes | Adds the settled amount to `streams.withdrawn`, zeroes `balance` and `rate`, sets `status = CANCELLED`. No-ops if the stream row does not exist. Emits a `stream_cancelled` notification. |
| `topup` | No | The event only publishes the new deposit amount, not how much accrued and settled to the NGO during the same call, so the post-topup balance cannot be reconstructed from the payload alone without either a contract read or duplicating the accrual math. Tracked as a follow-up. |
| `ratemod` | No | Same reason as `topup` — the new rate is known but the accrual that settled at the moment of the rate change is not. Tracked as a follow-up. |

Handler: [`src/indexer/handlers/donationVault.ts`](../src/indexer/handlers/donationVault.ts)

## Checkpoint

The indexer stores the last ledger it successfully processed in the
`indexer_checkpoints` table (a single row with `id = 'main'`).  On startup it
reads this row and resumes from `lastLedger +1`, so a restart never
re-processes already-seen events.

**First run** — if no checkpoint row exists the indexer writes the current
ledger as the starting point and returns without fetching events. The next poll
picks up from there, so only events emitted *after* the first startup are
indexed; the contract's full history is not back-filled.

**Per-event checkpointing** — the checkpoint is saved after each individual
event, not once per batch. Several handlers apply relative deltas
(`balance -= accrued`, etc.), so replaying an already-applied event after a
Crash would double-count it. Saving after each event bounds the damage to "at most the in-flight event" on a crash.

### Failed events

A handler decodes an event's payload with unchecked casts, so an event whose
shape does not match what the handler expects throws. That throw used to
escape the poll loop before the checkpoint was saved, which meant the same
event came back on the next poll, threw again, and blocked every later event
behind it — permanently, since re-reading an undecodable event never makes it
decodable.

Each event is now handled in isolation. A failure is logged, recorded in the
`indexer_dead_letters` table (keyed on the RPC's event id, with the ledger,
contract id and the error message), and the checkpoint advances past it as
normal, so one bad event costs exactly that event rather than the whole
indexer.

Nothing reads those rows automatically — they exist so a failure is
inspectable and replayable by hand rather than silently dropped:

```sql
SELECT event_id, ledger, contract_id, error FROM indexer_dead_letters ORDER BY ledger;
```

Recording a dead letter is deliberately *not* fault-tolerant. If that write
throws, the database is unreachable — a transient fault, not a bad event — and
letting it propagate leaves the checkpoint unmoved so the event is retried on
the next poll instead of being skipped over a blip.

### Out-of-window behaviour

The Stellar RPC only retains a sliding window of recent ledgers (typically the
last ~17,280 ledgers / ~24 hours on Mainnet). It rejects a `getEvents` call
whose `startLedger` falls outside that window with a JSON-RPC `-32600` error.

Two ways the checkpoint can fall outside the window:

| Scenario | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Ahead of the tip** | The indexer checkpoints at the latest ledger, so the very next poll asks for `latest + 1`, which has not closed yet. The poll returns immediately and waits for the next interval — no action needed. |
| **Behind the retention window** | If the process is down for longer than the RPC's retention period, the saved checkpoint ages out. The indexer detects the `-32600` error, logs a warning that events in the gap were missed, skips the checkpoint forward to the current ledger, and resumes. This keeps the indexer running rather than looping on a permanent error, at the cost of a gap in the indexed history. |

The skip-forward warning is intentionally loud:

```
indexer: checkpoint <N> has aged out of the RPC's retention window —
skipping to ledger <M>. Events in between were missed and will not be indexed.
```

If you need complete history after an outage longer than the retention window,
replay the missed ledger range from an archive node (not currently automated).
## Verification reconciliation

If the indexer misses an `approved` / `revoked` event (e.g. because the
checkpoint aged out of the RPC retention window), an NGO's `verified` flag
can drift from the on-chain truth. The reconciliation script reads each NGO's
verified status directly from the ngo-registry contract and compares it against
the database, reporting (and optionally fixing) any mismatches.

### Running it

The script lives at [`src/scripts/reconcileVerification.ts`](../src/scripts/reconcileVerification.ts).
It requires `NGO_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` and a Stellar RPC endpoint to be set
(the same environment variables the indexer uses), and access to the database.

Report only (default) — prints mismatches and exits with code 1 if any are found:

```bash
npm run reconcile:verification
```

Apply fixes — updates the database to match on-chain status:

```bash
npm run reconcile:verification -- --fix
```

Add `--quiet` to suppress the per-NGO output and only print the final summary.

The script exits with code 0 when everything matches (or when `--fix` is used),
and code 1 when mismatches are found in report-only mode.

## Polling and backoff

The indexer polls on a self-rescheduling timer rather than a fixed
`setInterval`: each poll schedules the next one only once it has settled. Two
things follow from that. Polls can never overlap, however slow the RPC is. And
a failed poll decides when the next attempt happens, instead of the interval
timer firing regardless of how the previous one went.

A healthy indexer polls every `INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default 5s). When a
poll fails — `getLatestLedger`, `getEvents`, or a throwing event handler — the
delay to the next poll doubles, up to a cap of 5 minutes:

| Consecutive failures               | 0  | 1  | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    | 7+   |
| ---------------------------------- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| Delay (at the default 5s interval) | 5s | 5s | 10s | 20s | 40s | 80s | 160s | 300s |

The first failure retries at the normal interval, so a single dropped request
costs nothing. The cap matters for two reasons: a long outage must not drift out
to a delay that looks like a hung indexer, and the indexer still re-checks the
endpoint at a predictable rate so recovery is detected within the cap.

The counter resets on the first poll that completes, so a single success drops
the delay straight back to `INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` — one bad patch does not
leave the indexer crawling for the rest of its life.

Failed polls leave the checkpoint where it was, so retries re-scan the same
ledger range. The log line names the failure count and the next delay:

```
indexer poll failed (3 in a row) — retrying in 20000ms
