# StreamGive — Backend

Indexer and API for StreamGive, a recurring/streaming donation platform for
verified NGOs on Stellar. Watches the on-chain contracts for events and
serves the data that powers the frontend.

## Stack

- TypeScript, Node.js
- Fastify (API server)
- PostgreSQL

## Local development

```
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres   # starts Postgres (+ a streamgive_test DB)
npm install
npm run db:push                 # sync the schema onto streamgive
npm run dev
```

To run the whole stack containerized instead, after `npm run db:push` above: `docker compose up --build`.

To run the integration test suite, additionally:

```
cp .env.test.example .env.test
npm run db:push:test
npm test
```

## Notification events

When `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, the indexer POSTs a JSON body to that URL
for each on-chain event it processes (see
[src/notifications/service.ts](./src/notifications/service.ts)). The body is
one of the following shapes, discriminated by `type`
(see [src/notifications/types.ts](./src/notifications/types.ts)):

### `stream_created`

Emitted when a donor opens a new donation stream to an NGO.

```json
{
  "type": "stream_created",
  "streamId": "1234",
  "donorAddress": "GABC...",
  "ngoId": "clx1y2z3..."
}
```

- `streamId` — the stream's on-chain id, as a string.
- `donorAddress` — the donor's Stellar account address.
- `ngoId` — the internal (database) id of the receiving NGO.

### `stream_withdrawn`

Emitted when accrued funds are withdrawn to the NGO from an active stream.

```json
{
  "type": "stream_withdrawn",
  "streamId": "1234",
  "amount": "500000000"
}
```

- `streamId` — the stream's on-chain id, as a string.
- `amount` — the amount withdrawn, in the stream's token base units, as a string.

### `stream_cancelled`

Emitted when a stream is cancelled, settling accrued funds to the NGO and
refunding the remaining balance to the donor.

```json
{
  "type": "stream_cancelled",
  "streamId": "1234",
  "settledToNgo": "500000000",
  "refundToDonor": "1500000000"
}
```

- `streamId` — the stream's on-chain id, as a string.
- `settledToNgo` — the amount settled to the NGO at cancellation time, in the stream's token base units, as a string.
- `refundToDonor` — the amount refunded to the donor, in the stream's token base units, as a string.
